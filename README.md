##### What does it do?
What inspired me the most about this project was the potential impact that it could have on people's lives. Early detection of cancer can be the difference between life and death, and the fact that we have created a tool that could potentially save lives is truly inspiring.Our website allows users to detect brain and lung cancer in the early stages, right now we focused on lung and brain cancer through a series of tests, this allows users to understand how they may be at risk and possibly consult a doctor. 

##### Features

BrainWave is a web-app with two tests to detect early stage cancer:

- WHEEZING DETECTION: We analyzed spectrograms to understand whether a person is breathing regularly or is slightly wheezing, this helps us understand whether lung cancer could eventually develop

- MEMORY TEST: We created a memory test where users could use their hands to repersent the pattern that had been shown on the screen prior

- SPEECH TEST: We also tested whether users could speak clearly
